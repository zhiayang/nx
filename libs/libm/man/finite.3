.Sh NAME
.Nm finite ,
.Nm finitef
.Nd tests for finite values
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft int
.Fn finite "double x"
.Ft int
.Fn finitef "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn finite
function returns the value 1 when
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
\-\*(If \*(Lt
.Fa x
\*(Lt +\*(If.
.Ed
.Pp
Otherwise a zero is returned
(that is,
.Pf \*(Ba Ns Fa x Ns \*(Ba
= \*(If or
.Fa x
is \*(Na).
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr isfinite 3 ,
.Xr math 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The described functions conform to
.St -ieee754 .
Note that unlike
.Xr isfinite 3 ,
neither function is present in the
.Dv ISO
C-language standards or in the
.Dv IEEE
.Dv POSIX
standards.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm finite
and
.Fn finitef
functions first appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
