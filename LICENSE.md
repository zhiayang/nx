We currently bundle OVMF binaries together in the repo, because building from source is not something I wish upon anybody. Its license is reproduced below:

## BOOTBOOT ##

For booting on non-UEFI systems on x86-64, we currently employ the BOOTBOOT loader. We ship a modified version of `bootboot.bin`
that skips SMP initialisation. This was achieved by inserting `jmp .nosmp` before the SMP initialisation code. The BOOTBOOT
specification and its reference implementation are licensed under the MIT license:
